// Dont use the visited boolean array beacuse we want to have all the path possible.
Use DFS but we cannot use visited [] to keep track of visited vertices since we need to explore all the paths. visited [] is used avoid going into cycles during iteration. (That is why we have a condition in this problem that graph does not contain cycle)
Start from the source vertex and make a recursive call to all it adjacent vertices.
