Given a Directed Graph, find a Mother Vertex in the Graph (if present). 
A Mother Vertex is a vertex through which we can reach all the other vertices of the Graph.
Output: 0
Explanation: According to the given edges, all 
nodes can be reaced from nodes from 0, 1 and 2. 
But, since 0 is minimum among 0,1 and 3, so 0 
is the output.
