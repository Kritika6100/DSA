//Edge are given in terms of the matrix where it shows connections between u and v
//star centre is the node which is connected to all other nodes by observations
//There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. 
Return the center of the given star graph.
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
Example 2:

Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1

Every element is connected to a common element
find that common element by using first two row
edge[1][0]==edge[0][0]|| edge[1][0]==edge[0][1]?edge[1][0]:edge[1][1];
